# Smart Soil Quality Monitoring & Crop Recommendation System 🌾

An intelligent, full-stack web application designed to help farmers and agricultural enthusiasts optimize crop yields. The system analyzes essential soil parameters (such as Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium levels, and pH) to recommend the most suitable crop for a given region using a trained machine learning model.
